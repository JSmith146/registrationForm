## Registration Form

Now that we've learned about all of the different types of form tags, let's create a registration form using only HTML. When registering for any website, whether it's for an email account, a social media platform, or even this bootcamp, you are submitting a form! You will be using lots and lots of forms over the next few months to send data to your backend so let's get comfortable creating some forms.

Recreate all the html elements shown on the image above! As you haven't learned yet how to use css to make the form look nice, don't worry about how your registration form looks for now.

Your HTML should contain the following tags:

input with these values in the "type" attribute:
text
